    <p><div> <i> By Tim Herrera - The New York Times </i>    </div>
      Two weeks ago we talked about beating procrastination and getting stuff done. Clearly I still have a lot to learn.
      But I asked you all for your tips, and hundreds of you emailed or tweeted your best advice for starting tasks and getting
      across the finish line. (And some of you just wrote in to commiserate, which was lovely. We’re all just trying our best out here.)
      Many of your tips were fantastic. They were so good, in fact, that I wanted to share a few of my favorites....

    <p><div> <i> By Daniel Wong - Duke University </i>    </div>
      168. That’s how many hours there are in a week. If you’re a student, you probably feel like this isn’t enough. I know …
      You have so many assignments to do, projects to work on, and tests to study for. Plus, you have other activities and commitments.
      And I’m sure you want to have a social life, too. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could study smarter (not harder), get good grades, and
      lead a balanced life? Of course it would. That’s why I wrote this article. The main aim of education isn’t to get straight A’s. But
      learning how to learn is a vital life skill. So I spent hours scouring scientific articles and research journals to find the best ways to learn more effectively.

    <p><div><i>By Nate Kornell - Williams College </i> </div>
      Good students don't just study harder, they study smarter. A study published this week identifies some habits of successful college students.
      I'll describe the new study shortly, but first: How should students study? A growing body of cognitive psychology research emphasizes the value of two principles:
      Principle one is space your studying out over time. If you study something and then study it again right away, it's fresh in your mind the second time. You'll
      probably feel like you've learned it well. Don't be fooled. Instead of restudying right away, wait a while (e.g., an hour, a day, a week) and then study again.
      You'll learn far more. Spacing works because when something's fresh in your mind you don't learn much from studying it; you learn more when you've had time to
      forget it, which allows you to strengthen the memory anew.

    <p><div><i>Nicole Glass - USA Today College</i> </div>
      Countless students leave behind years of college without the connection they so strongly wish they had made. The constant visits to their professors’ office
      hours proved fruitless in establishing a lifelong relationship.Left without a mentor, these students venture into the real world without the guidance of someone
      they may have looked up to in the classroom.I thought I would be one of those students — until I sent my former journalism professor an email, which led to further
      emails, phone calls, coffee dates and a position to assist her with research for her next book.
