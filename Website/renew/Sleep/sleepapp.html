  <h3><strong>Why Is Sleep Important?</strong></h3>
    <p>Getting enough quality sleep each night helps you be the best version of yourself.
      During sleep, the body repairs and regulates itself. Ongoing sleep deficiency
      affects how well you think, react, work, learn, and get along with others. How rested you feel is not only dependent on how many hours you have slept, but also on what stage of the sleep cycle you wake up in. It is ideal to wake up in the light sleep part of the sleep cycle and avoid waking up during REM sleep, when in the middle of a dream.  A 2014 study from Tel Aviv University found that just one night of startling wake-ups was enough to create serious confusion and irritation the next day, and to impact negatively on participants' job performance. The scientists found that interrupted sleep had the same poor consequences for cognition as only getting four hours of sleep a night.
