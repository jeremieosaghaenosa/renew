     <p> <div> <i> By David Clap - Huffington Post</i> </div>
       As someone who has spent the vast majority of his adult life single, I like to think
       I’ve come up with useful tactics for combating what seems like constant pressure to
       find a significant other. At times, when it nearly breaks me, I’ll remind myself of all
       the reasons I’d rather be single than take up a hasty courtship with someone I’m not
       certain about. While I’m all for dating and dating often, I’m also for reflecting on
       what I want out of my dating life and honoring my answer. If you’re like me,
       faced with albeit well-intentioned outside pressure to leave your single life behind,
       but just aren’t ready to budge until you feel you’ve met someone of importance, here
       are some pointers to help you stay the course......

     <p><div> <i> By Daniel Jones - The New York Times </i> </div>
       In Mandy Len Catron’s Modern Love essay, “To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This,” she refers
       to a study by the psychologist Arthur Aron (and others) that explores whether intimacy between
       two strangers can be accelerated by having them ask each other a specific series of personal
       questions. The 36 questions in the study are broken up into three sets, with each set intended
       to be more probing than the previous one.The idea is that mutual vulnerability fosters closeness.....

     <p><div> <i> By Emily Esfahani Smith - Business Insider </i> </div>
       Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity.
       Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples
       will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love
       that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out
       that way for most people.The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving
       into bitterness and dysfunction......

   <li style="list-style-type: none;"><h3> How to Heal the Fear of Being Cheated On When You Are in a Healthy Relationship</h3>
     <p><div> <i> By Silvia Solls - Huffington Post </i> </div>
       Maria grew up watching her mother cry her eyes out every time Maria’s dad cheated on her. Even though Maria’s
       parents were very much in love when they married, they, like most couples, didn’t know what to do after the
       passion dwindled in their relationship. Once inseparable, this couple drifted with the daily routine and
       constant responsibility that came with raising Maria.
       Without the faintest clue as to how to recapture the connection and passion they naturally felt at the beginning
       of their relationship, Maria’s parents fell victim to the difficulty of maintaining a long-lasting relationship
       and, little by little, their relationship devolved into two strangers living under the same roof. The only ties
       they shared were the vows they exchanged at their wedding, and their love for their daughter....
